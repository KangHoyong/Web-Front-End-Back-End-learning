            At this time, we have achieved the initial implementation of most of these features; however,
             due to parallel development paths our implementation of Inter-Blockchain Communication exists 
             on a separate branch that will not be used for the initial test network.<br><br><br>

            Those interested in performance-testing our EOS.IO Dawn 2.0 release will find that all blockchain 
            and network code necessary to launch and operate a private network can be found in our Github repository. 
            Our internal testing shows we can sustain several thousand transfers per second and 1 second blocks using 
            our single-threaded implementation on average hardware. That said, there are known attack vectors for which 
            we have unimplemented solutions. For example, compilation of new contracts for the first time can take up to 
            34ms, which if exploited could cause the network to fragment at transaction rates over 30 TPS.<br><br><br>
