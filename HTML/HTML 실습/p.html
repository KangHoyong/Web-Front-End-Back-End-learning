        <p>At this time, we have achieved the initial implementation of most of these features; however, 
        due to parallel development paths our implementation of Inter-Blockchain Communication exists on a separate branch 
        that will not be used for the initial test network.</p>

        <p>Those interested in performance-testing our EOS.IO Dawn 2.0 
        release will find that all blockchain and network code necessary to launch and operate a private 
        network can be found in our Github repository.</p>
